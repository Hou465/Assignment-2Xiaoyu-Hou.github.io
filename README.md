 planning for drunks
## Descriptions 
### The basic algorithm is, for each drunk (who will have numbers between 10 and 250 assigned before leaving the pub), move the drunk randomly left/right/up/down in a loop that picks randomly the way it will go. When it hits the correctly numbered house, stop the process and start with the next drunk. At each step for each drunk, add one to the density for that point on the map.
## Main Steps
### 1.Pull in the data file and finds out the pub point and the home points.
### 2.Draws the pub and homes on the screen.
### 3.Models the drunks leaving their pub and reaching their homes, and stores how many drunks pass through each point on the map.
### 4.Draws the density of drunks passing through each point on a map.
### 5.Saves the density map to a file as text.

## Liscence
# Softerware is Python
# How it can be run 
## *In CMD
C:\Users\lenovo>cd "C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\GitHub"
C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\GitHub>dir
C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\GitHub>cd 201078224Assignment1.github.io
C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\GitHub\201078224Assignment1.github.io>dir
C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\GitHub\201078224Assignment1.github.io>WorkFINAL.py
## *In Spyder
Click 'File'---Open---Find the directory of your ---Click 'Run'
# What is to be expected when it is run
## You can see drunks start from the bar,walk randomly till they get home,and a density map is created.
