### 4.Draws the density of drunks passing through each point on a map.
### 5.Saves the density map to a file as text.
# Contents (a simple list of what all the files/directories are)
### untitled.py(my agentframework)
### WorkFINAL3.py(my module)
## Liscence
# Softerware is Python
# How it can be run

## *In Spyder
Click 'File'---Open---Find the directory of your ---Click 'Run'
# What is to be expected when it is run
## You can see drunks start from the bar,walk randomly till they get home,and a density map is created.
